S#
============

S# (pronounced as safety sharp) is a formal modeling and analysis framework for safety-critical systems.
It is specifically designed to foster the development of high-quality, comprehensible,
and adequate models of safety-critical systems. It hides
the details of the underlying formal analysis techniques,
allowing the safety engineer to concentrate on the creation
of the models.
