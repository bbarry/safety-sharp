parsing Tests
==========================
nestedComponent1.safetysharp: 2 Components with do-nothing behaviour: 1 parent with 1 subcomponent.
nestedComponent2.safetysharp: 5 Components with do-nothing behaviour: 1 parent with 2 subcomponents. Each subcomponent has 1 subcomponent
simpleComponent1.safetysharp: 1 Component with do-nothing behaviour
simpleComponent2.safetysharp: 1 Component with do-nothing behaviour and 5 fields with indeterministic initialization
simpleComponent3.safetysharp: 1 Component with do-nothing behaviour and 2 fields with the same name (incorrect program)
simpleComponent4.safetysharp: 1 Component with do-nothing behaviour and 1 required port
simpleComponent5.safetysharp: 1 Component with do-nothing behaviour and 1 provided port
simpleComponent6.safetysharp: 1 Component with do-nothing behaviour and 1 provided port, 2 required ports, 1 instantaneous binding, 1 delayed binding
simpleComponent7.safetysharp: 1 Component with do-nothing behaviour and 1 provided port, 2 required ports, 1 instantaneous binding, 1 delayed binding. Every component has a field


simple Statements Tests
(everything except (beh) and (call))
==========================
simpleStatement1.safetysharp: 1 Component with one local variable, assignment to variable
simpleStatement2.safetysharp: 1 Component with one field, assignment to field with current field value
simpleStatement3.safetysharp: 1 Component with one local variable, assignment to local variable, reading from local variable



(beh)-Tests
==========================
beh1.safetysharp: nested 
beh2.safetysharp: nested with fields


(call)-Tests
==========================


(cmd)-Tests
==========================


TODO:
- Nested Beh-Calls
- Nested Provided-Calls
- Writeback to Beh (when behaviour port gets value from provided-port)
- Writeback of Inout to Provided (when provided port  gets value from provided-port)
- Reading of writeback
- Context 
- Reading of Local Var in Provided
- Reading of Local Var in Beh
- Reading of Inout Var in Provided
- Position of provided port same/different, correctly differentiated

- always differentiate between these two cases: CurrentCall:K is an Id of a provided Port/ is empty, because source is a component-behaviour
